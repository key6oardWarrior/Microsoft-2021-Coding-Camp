<h1>Text Based Adventure Game</h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Find keys laying around the room</li>
	<li>Each key the user collects must be stored in a list.</li>
	<li>Since each key is a string that will be stored in a list all the keys collected <b>MUST</b> make a sentence</li>
	<li>The user <b>MUST</b> collect all the keys out of order. For example, room 1 will have a key that is the word: Won and room 2 will have a key that says I. If you put those keys in order then you get "I won"</li>
	<li>Every time a user enters a room they must type "Find Key". This is case senitive</li>
	<li>To move to the next room the user must type "walk". This is not case senitive</li>
	<li>When the user collects all the keys you must print the list and make the user guess what the sentence is. For example, if the list is ["won", "I"] when the user guesses "I won" then they will escape the room. This is also case senitive</li>
	<li>What can you do to make the code for this game less repetive</li>
</ol>
