# Flowchart Programming

The object of this lab will be to practice problem-solving using computational thinking, by programming with flowcharts in RAPTOR.

## 1: Fuel Meter

Using RAPTOR, create a flowchart that acts as a fuel checker in a car: it should ask the user for the distance to their destination, and how far they will be able to travel using the
fuel in their tank currently. The program should output whether the user will need more fuel to reach their destination, and if so, how much.

## 2: Voting Checker

Using RAPTOR, create a flowchart that acts as a simple voter registration machine: it should ask the user their age and current state of residence. If their age is equal to or greater than
18 and their state of residence is Maryland then the program should tell the user that they are eligible to vote. Otherwise, it should tell them that they are not eligible to vote.
