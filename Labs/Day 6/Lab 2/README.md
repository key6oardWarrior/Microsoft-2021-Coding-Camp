# Rock, Paper, Scissors

The object of this lab will be to practice using functions, as well as to demonstrate the utility of using functions.

## Bad Practice

Included here are two .py files. The file named "rps_no_functions.py" contains a fully functional game of rock, paper, scissors, written without the use of function definitions.
You can open the file to look at the code, and run it on repl.it to play rock, paper, scissors with the computer.

Observe that the code is fairly dense and difficult to understand (especially since there are no comments).
If one wanted to reuse or modify this code, they would need to spend a lot of time and effort to read through it. Because ease of reuse and maintainence is very important in computer science, writing code like this is generally discouraged.

## Good Practice

The file named "rps_functions.py" contains a template for writing a game of rock, paper, scissors, but this time with the use of function definitions.
Each of the defined functions comes with a comment describing the intended behavior of that function. This version of the code is longer, but more compartmentalized and easier to comprehend.

Directions: Fill in the blanks in rps_functions.py so that it recreates the functionality of rps_no_functions.py; that is, so that it lets you play rock, paper, scissors against the computer.

Note that the code outside of the function definitions should work properly and will not need to be changed in order to complete the lab as long as the code inside the function definitions is written.
That said, you are welcome to make whatever modifications you like to the code, so long as it works. There are multiple solutions to every problem.
