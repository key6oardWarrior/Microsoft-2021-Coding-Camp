# FizzBuzz Redux

The object of this lab will be to practice using conditionals with loops.

## Play FizzBuzz with a range of numbers

Directions: Write a program that takes in an integer and counts up to that number while playing FizzBuzz.
In FizzBuzz, one counts up; if a number is a multiple of 3, one says "Fizz" instead of that number.
If it is a multiple of 5, one says "Buzz" instead of that number.
If it is a multiple of both 3 and 5, one says "FizzBuzz" instead.

Example execution:

> Please input a number: <br>
> \> 17 <br>
> 1 <br>
> 2 <br>
> Fizz <br>
> 4 <br>
> Buzz <br>
> Fizz <br>
> 7 <br>
> 8 <br>
> Fizz <br>
> Buzz <br>
> 11 <br>
> Fizz <br>
> 13 <br>
> 14 <br>
> FizzBuzz <br>
> 16 <br>
> 17
