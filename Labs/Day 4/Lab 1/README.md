# Drawing Shapes

The object of this lab will be to practice using loops and variables.

## 1: Draw a Square
Directions: Write a program that takes in an integer as side length and prints to console a square of those dimensions.

Example execution:

> Please input a side length: <br>
> \> 4 <br>
> XXXX <br>
> XXXX <br>
> XXXX <br>
> XXXX <br>

## 2: Draw a Rectangle
Directions: Write a program that takes in two integers as height and width and prints to console a rectangle of those dimensions.

Example execution:

> Please input a height: <br>
> \> 3 <br>
> Please input a width: <br>
> \> 5 <br>
> XXXXX <br>
> XXXXX <br>
> XXXXX <br>

## 3: Draw a Triangle
Directions: Write a program that takes in an integer as height and prints to console a right triangle of that height, as shown below.

Example execution:

> Please input a height: <br>
> \> 4 <br>
> X <br>
> XX <br>
> XXX <br>
> XXXX <br>

Extra challenge: Can you write a program that prints the triangle upside down, like this?
> XXXX <br>
> XXX <br>
> XX <br>
> X
