	<li>The user must have up and down controls to make the player move up and down.</li>
	<li>Shapes must come to the user from the other side of the screen. The shape that come from the other side must come at random times, for example, if the first shape takes 1 second to appear then the second shape must take a different amount of time to appear and each time must be random.</li>
