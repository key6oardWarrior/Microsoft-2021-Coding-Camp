# Debugging Practice

The object of this lab will be to practice basic debugging, which involves attention to detail and a knowledge of syntax.

## 1: Trivia Printer

Under the heading "1: Trivia Printer" in the included .py file, there is a short program that is intended to print some interesting trivia.

Expected execution:
> On a standard six-sided die, the sum of any two opposing sides will always be 7! <br>
> Snakes do not have eyelids; instead, their eyes are covered by a pair of transparent scales!

Try running this code in Replit. Observe how the actual output differs from the expected output above. <br>
Then, see if you can change the code in repl.it so that it functions as intended.

## 2: Age Predictor

Under the heading "2: Age Predictor" in the included .py file, there is a short program that is intended to "predict" your age in one year.
It should take in an integer as the user's age, add one to that number, then print that number as the user's age next year.

Expected execution:
> What is your current age, in years? <br>
> \> 20 <br>
> In one year, you will be 21 years old.

Try running this code in Replit. Observe how the actual output differs from the expected output above. <br>
Then, see if you can change the code in repl.it so that it functions as intended.

## 3: Reading Time

Under the heading "3: Reading Time" in the included .py file, there is a short program that is intended to calculate how long a book will take to read.
It should take in two integers as the number of pages and how many pages the user can read in one hour, then calculate how long the user will take to read the book.

Expected execution:
> How many pages does the book have? <br>
> \> 325 <br>
> How many pages can you read in an hour? <br>
> \> 50 <br>
> The book will take 6.5 hours to read.

Try running this code in Replit. Observe how the actual output differs from the expected output above. <br>
Then, see if you can change the code in repl.it so that it functions as intended.
