# Using Replit and Python

[Replit](replit.com) is a versatile online development environment that can be run in a web browser. It requires almost no setup, so we will be using it as a coding platform.

Once you've logged in, the blue "+" button in the top-right can be used to create a new program. You will be asked to pick a language and name; we recommend you choose Python for the language and something inoffensive for the name.

Creating a program will bring you to the editor, where you can do actual coding. Once you have code written in the text box, you can click the "run" button at the top of the screen or press ctrl+enter to run your code. Any output (or error messages) will appear in the console.

After you've familiarized yourself with the interface, try writing some basic programs as instructed in Lab 1 to get a feel for Python.
