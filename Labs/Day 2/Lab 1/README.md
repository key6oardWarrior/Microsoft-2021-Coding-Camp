# Basic inputs and outputs

The object of this lab will be to practice using variables and Python syntax.

## 1: Introduce Yourself

Directions: Write a short program that prints your name, birthday, and a fact about yourself on three separate lines.

Example execution:
> My name is Alfonso VIII of Castille. <br>
> My birthday is November 11th. <br>
> I was king of Castille from 1158 to 1214 CE. <br>

## 2: Counting Sandwiches

Directions: Write a program that takes in an integer as the number of sandwiches, then repeats back that number of sandwiches and how many slices of bread they contain. <br>
(Assume the sandwiches are of standard construction and contain two slices of bread each.)

Example execution:
> How many sandwiches do you have? <br>
> \> 7 <br>
> You have 7 sandwiches? <br>
> There are 14 slices of bread in those sandwiches.

## 3: Exponential Calculator

Directions: Write a program that takes in two integers: a number to take the power of, and a power to which to raise the first number. It should then print out the result of taking that power.

Example execution:
> Please input a number: <br>
> \> 2 <br>
> Please input a power to raise that number to: <br>
> \> 5 <br>
> 32
